# Leap Year TDD

Make a web page that tells you if a year is a leap year or not.

Leap years are divisible by 4 (like 1992 and 1996). There is an exception, though, and an exception to the exception: if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year (like 1900), unless it is also divisible by 400 (like the year 2000).
